The building formerly called the Sansum Multi-Speciality Clinic at 1225 North H Street. At Lompoc Health, you’ll see many of the same fantastic staff and providers you have for the past decade – as well as many new faces. Lompoc Health – North H Street recognizes all Sansum insurance contracts, including HMO plans and CenCal Health.

To make appointments, or for other inquiries, please call (805) 737-8700, the same phone number previously used for the clinic. Same-Day appointments are available from 9 am to 9 pm every day.

An on-site laboratory draw station is now open at North H Center. However, Sansum HMO patients will continue to use laboratory services at Pacific Diagnostic Labs. Any patient's with other HMO or PPO insurances are welcome to use the North H Center Laboratory.
